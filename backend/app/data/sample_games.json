This hyperplane should be as far as possible from the nearest data points of each class, known as support vectors. The classifier uses constraints to ensure that all data points are correctly classified with a margin of at least half the width of the hyperplane.\n\n  Build an interactive web app to help learners understand the concept of a hard margin classifier and its mechanics.\n\n  SPECIFICATIONS:\n\n  1. The app must feature a scatter plot with draggable blue plus signs and red minus signs representing positive and negative examples, respectively.\n  2. The app must allow users to draw a green line (hyperplane) on the scatter plot and adjust its position and orientation.\n  3. The app must display two dashed lines (margins) parallel to the hyperplane, indicating the forbidden region where no data points should lie.\n  4. The app must highlight the support vectors (nearest data points to the hyperplane) with circles and display their coordinates.\n  5. The app must calculate and display the margin width and the distance of the support vectors from the hyperplane.\n  6. The app must provide a button to automatically adjust the hyperplane to maximize the margin, ensuring all data points are correctly classified.\n  7. The app must allow users to toggle between viewing the hyperplane equation (w^T x + b = 0) and the margin equations (w^T x + b = ±1).\n  8. The app must include a section to explain the concept of support vectors and their role in defining the hyperplane.\n  9. The app must include a section to explain the objective function (minimize 1/2 * ||w||²) and the constraints (y_i(w^T x_i + b) >= 1) used in the SVM formulation.\n  10. The app must allow users to add or remove data points and observe how the hyperplane and margins adjust accordingly.\n  11. The app must include a simple tutorial or guide to help users understand how to use the app and interpret the results.\"\n}\n```",
