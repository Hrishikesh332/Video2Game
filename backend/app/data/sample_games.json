It involves fitting a line through data points to make predictions on unknown data, assuming a linear relationship between the variables. The coefficients of the line (slope and intercept) are optimized to minimize the sum of squared errors, which is the difference between the data points and the predictions the line would produce. This process can be extended to multiple input variables, visualized as a hyperplane in higher dimensions. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, standard error of the estimate, and statistical significance.
